## JavaScript Programming
This repository is a small, hands-on JavaScript learning path. Each file is a tiny, runnable example focused on a single idea, arranged in a clear order. You can read through the files like a short textbook and execute each one as you go.

<br>

## Requirements
- **JavaScript runtime**: Node.js (recommended) or a modern web browser.
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code.
- **Extensions** (for the full repo experience):
  - **JavaScript and TypeScript** (built in to VS Code).
  - **Code Runner** extension to run `.js` files quickly from the editor.
  - **Live Server** extension to run the HTML + CSS + JavaScript mini projects.

**Quick setup with VS Code**
1. Install Visual Studio Code and add the Code Runner and Live Server extensions.
2. Install Node.js and make sure the `node` command works in the VS Code terminal.
3. Open this folder in VS Code (`File` → `Open Folder...`).
4. Open any `.js` file and use the Code Runner play icon to run it, or run it from the integrated terminal with `node path/to/file.js`.
5. For the HTML practice files, right-click the `.html` file in VS Code and choose `Open with Live Server` to see live updates as you work.

For more details, see the official VS Code docs: [JavaScript in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript).

## Learning Path
### Basics
- **[01 – Variables](libs/01-variables.js)**: Declaring and using variables.
- **[02 – Data Types](libs/02-data-types.js)**: Primitive types and how values are represented.
- **[03 – Type Casting](libs/03-type-casting.js)**: Converting between different types.
- **[04 – User Input](libs/04-user-input.js)**: Reading input from the user.
- **[05 – Escape Sequences](libs/05-escape-sequences.js)**: Special characters inside strings.

### Operators and Expressions
- **[06 – Math Operators](libs/06-math-operators.js)**: Arithmetic operations and expressions.
- **[07 – Math Functions](libs/07-math-functions.js)**: Useful functions from the `Math` object.
- **[08 – Ternary Operator](libs/08-ternary-operators.js)**: Compact conditional expressions.

### Control Flow
- **[09 – If Statements](libs/09-if-statements.js)**: Basic conditional branching.
- **[10 – Switch Statements](libs/10-switch-statements.js)**: Multi-way branching for discrete values.

### Extras and Utilities
- **[11 – Random Numbers](libs/11-random-numbers.js)**: Generating random values and simple uses.

<br>

### Practice Scripts (Mini Projects)
These examples use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. Open the `.html` files in a browser or with Live Server to interact with them.

- **[Counter](scripts/counter/counter.html)**: Clickable counter to practice DOM updates and events.
- **[Circumference Calculator](scripts/circumference/circumference.html)**: Small form-based calculator.
- **[Random Number Generator App](scripts/randomNumberGenerator/randomNumberGenerator.html)**: UI wrapper around a random number generator.
- **[Checked Property Demo](scripts/checkedProperty/checkedProperty.html)**: Working with checkbox state in the DOM.

## How to work through the repo
- **New to JavaScript?** Start with `01-variables.js` and move forward in numeric order. Each file introduces one idea at a time.
- **Need a refresher on a topic?** Jump directly to the relevant section and open the numbered example for that concept.
- **Preparing for practice or interviews?** Work through the Basics and Control Flow sections, then spend extra time on the Practice Scripts to solidify your understanding with small projects.
